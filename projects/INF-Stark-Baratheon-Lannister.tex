\notocsubsection{\prsum}

All projects within \thiscrc{} will gather and analyze data of some
kind, most prominently experimental data. To effectively
turn these data into a useful resource for the CRC and the field as a
whole, project \PPs{INF} will support key aspects of empirical
research: data collection, processing, analysis (including modeling),
and storage. The project has four main interrelated goals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To assist individual projects of \thiscrc{} with their data
  management and analysis  
\item To extend individual consulting with active support for
  intensive, inter-project knowledge exchange in order to create
  synergies by aligning structures and creating general solutions for
  shared problems
\item To build, explore, and extend statistical methods tailored to
  the analysis of relevant phenomena for use by the individual
  projects and, crucially, to aggregate the findings in order to
  better understand the multivariate and multidimensional nature of
  relevant data
\item To deploy and maintain viable long-term storage solutions for
  the collected data, in compliance with DFG guidelines, thereby
  keeping these valuable assets available for future research
\end{enumerate}

The data collected within \thiscrc{} will be diverse, but will share
some important characteristics across different projects.
